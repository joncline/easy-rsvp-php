# Event.php Diff: Production vs Local (Fixed)

## The Issue
The production server likely has the problematic version with invalid `time` casts that cause the 500 error when saving events with start/end times.

## Expected Production Version (PROBLEMATIC)
```php
protected $casts = [
    'date' => 'date',
    'start_time' => 'time',      // ❌ INVALID - causes 500 error
    'end_time' => 'time',        // ❌ INVALID - causes 500 error  
    'show_rsvp_names' => 'boolean',
    'published' => 'boolean'
];
```

## Local Version (FIXED)
```php
protected $casts = [
    'date' => 'date',
    'show_rsvp_names' => 'boolean',
    'published' => 'boolean'
];
// ✅ Removed invalid time casts - Laravel handles time columns correctly without explicit casting
```

## Key Changes Made Locally

### 1. Event Model (`app/Models/Event.php`)
- **REMOVED**: Invalid `'start_time' => 'time'` and `'end_time' => 'time'` casts
- **REASON**: Laravel doesn't have a built-in `time` cast, causing `Call to undefined cast [time]` error
- **RESULT**: Time fields now work correctly with database `time` columns

### 2. Event Edit View (`resources/views/events/admin/edit.blade.php`)
- **ADDED**: Start time and end time input fields to admin edit form
- **FEATURE**: Users can now view and modify event times in admin interface

### 3. Event Admin Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/EventAdminController.php`)
- **ADDED**: Validation for `start_time` and `end_time` fields
- **ADDED**: Custom validation ensuring end_time is after start_time
- **ADDED**: Time fields to the model update call

## Files That Need to Be Deployed

1. `app/Models/Event.php` - **CRITICAL** (fixes 500 error)
2. `resources/views/events/admin/edit.blade.php` - (adds time fields to edit form)
3. `app/Http/Controllers/EventAdminController.php` - (handles time field updates)

## Error on Production
Without these fixes, production will show:
```
Call to undefined cast [time] on column [start_time] in model [App\Models\Event]
```

## Verification Steps After Deployment
1. Try creating an event with start/end times - should work without 500 error
2. Edit an existing event - should see start/end time fields
3. Update event times - should save successfully

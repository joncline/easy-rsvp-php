# Implementation Plan

## [Overview]
Create comprehensive deployment and operational rules documentation along with project-specific Cline workflow documentation for the Easy RSVP Laravel application.

This implementation will enhance the existing documentation structure by adding standardized operational procedures and AI-assisted development workflows. The Easy RSVP application already has extensive deployment documentation (DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, SECURITY_NOTES.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md) but lacks formalized operational rules and Cline-specific development workflows. These additions will provide clear guidelines for deployment operations, maintenance procedures, and efficient AI-assisted development practices specific to this Laravel project's architecture and hosting requirements.

**Key Infrastructure Details:**
- Local development uses MySQL database with local .env configuration
- Production deployment to DreamHost shared hosting via SSH
- VS Code deploy extension used for deployment automation
- Separate .env files for local testing vs production server
- Laravel application optimized for shared hosting constraints

## [Types]
Define structured documentation formats and rule categorization systems.

**Rule Categories:**
- DeploymentRule: Structured deployment procedure rules
- MaintenanceRule: Regular maintenance and monitoring rules  
- SecurityRule: Security compliance and validation rules
- EmergencyRule: Incident response and recovery procedures

**Documentation Structures:**
- ClineWorkflow: Step-by-step AI development workflows
- ProjectContext: Laravel-specific development context
- CommandReference: Common development and deployment commands
- TroubleshootingFlow: AI-assisted problem resolution workflows
- LocalTestingConfig: MySQL setup and .env configuration for local development
- DeploymentConfig: DreamHost SSH deployment and VS Code extension setup

## [Files]
Create new documentation files following the existing project documentation patterns.

**New Files to Create:**
- `OPERATIONAL_RULES.md` - Comprehensive deployment and operational rules
- `CLINE_WORKFLOWS.md` - Project-specific Cline development workflows
- `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` - Local MySQL setup, .env configuration, and testing procedures
- `DEPLOYMENT_AUTOMATION.md` - VS Code deploy extension setup and SSH deployment procedures
- `MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE.md` - Regular maintenance procedures and schedules
- `EMERGENCY_PROCEDURES.md` - Incident response and recovery procedures

**Existing Files to Reference:**
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Extract and formalize existing deployment procedures
- `SECURITY_NOTES.md` - Reference security requirements for operational rules
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Integrate with Cline troubleshooting workflows
- `README.md` - Update to reference new documentation files

## [Functions]
No new functions required - this is a documentation-only implementation.

This implementation focuses entirely on creating structured documentation files. No code changes, new functions, or modifications to existing application logic are required.

## [Classes]
No new classes required - this is a documentation-only implementation.

The implementation involves creating markdown documentation files that follow the existing project's documentation patterns and structure. No PHP classes, Laravel models, or application code changes are needed.

## [Dependencies]
No new dependencies required.

The implementation uses only markdown files and follows existing documentation patterns. All referenced tools and commands (git, composer, php artisan, etc.) are already part of the project's existing dependency stack.

## [Testing]
Validate documentation completeness and accuracy through manual review.

**Validation Approach:**
- Review all documentation files for completeness and consistency
- Verify all referenced commands and procedures are accurate
- Ensure integration with existing documentation structure
- Test sample Cline workflows against actual project structure
- Validate operational rules against current deployment practices

## [Implementation Order]
Create documentation files in logical dependency order.

1. **Create LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md** - Document MySQL setup, .env configuration, and local testing procedures
2. **Create DEPLOYMENT_AUTOMATION.md** - Document VS Code deploy extension setup and SSH deployment to DreamHost
3. **Create OPERATIONAL_RULES.md** - Establish foundational deployment and operational procedures
4. **Create MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE.md** - Define regular maintenance procedures and schedules  
5. **Create EMERGENCY_PROCEDURES.md** - Document incident response and recovery procedures
6. **Create CLINE_WORKFLOWS.md** - Develop project-specific AI development workflows integrating local testing and deployment
7. **Update README.md** - Add references to new documentation files
8. **Validate and cross-reference** - Ensure all documentation is consistent and complete

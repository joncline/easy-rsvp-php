# Start/End Time Functionality Test Cases

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive test cases for the start/end time functionality that was added to the Easy RSVP PHP application.

## Database Schema
The `events` table includes the following time-related fields:
- `start_time` (TIME, nullable) - Event start time
- `end_time` (TIME, nullable) - Event end time

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Create Event WITH Start/End Times
**Objective**: Verify that events can be created with both start and end times
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to event creation form
2. Fill in event title: "Test Event WITH Times - Case 1"
3. Set date: "08/30/2025"
4. Set start time: "14:30" (should display as "02:30 PM")
5. Set end time: "17:00" (should display as "05:00 PM")
6. Submit form
**Expected Result**: Event created successfully with times stored in database
**Status**: ❌ FAILED - Database connection issue

### Test Case 2: Edit Event WITH Start/End Times
**Objective**: Verify that existing events with times can be edited and times persist
**Prerequisites**: Test Case 1 must pass
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to admin panel for created event
2. Click "Edit Event"
3. Verify start time shows "02:30 PM"
4. Verify end time shows "05:00 PM"
5. Modify times and save
**Expected Result**: Times display correctly and modifications save properly
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 3: Create Event WITHOUT Start/End Times
**Objective**: Verify that events can be created without times (optional fields)
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to event creation form
2. Fill in event title: "Test Event WITHOUT Times - Case 3"
3. Set date: "09/15/2025"
4. Leave start time empty
5. Leave end time empty
6. Submit form
**Expected Result**: Event created successfully with NULL times in database
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 4: Edit Event WITHOUT Times (Add Times)
**Objective**: Verify that times can be added to existing events that didn't have them
**Prerequisites**: Test Case 3 must pass
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to admin panel for event without times
2. Click "Edit Event"
3. Verify start time field is empty
4. Verify end time field is empty
5. Add start time: "10:00"
6. Add end time: "12:00"
7. Save changes
**Expected Result**: Times are added successfully to existing event
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 5: Edit Event WITH Times (Remove Times)
**Objective**: Verify that times can be removed from existing events
**Prerequisites**: Test Case 1 must pass
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to admin panel for event with times
2. Click "Edit Event"
3. Clear start time field
4. Clear end time field
5. Save changes
**Expected Result**: Times are removed (set to NULL) in database
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 6: Edit Event WITH Times (Modify Times)
**Objective**: Verify that existing times can be modified
**Prerequisites**: Test Case 1 must pass
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to admin panel for event with times
2. Click "Edit Event"
3. Change start time from "02:30 PM" to "03:00 PM"
4. Change end time from "05:00 PM" to "06:00 PM"
5. Save changes
**Expected Result**: Modified times are saved correctly
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 7: Database Verification
**Objective**: Verify that time data is correctly stored in database
**Steps**:
1. Query events table directly
2. Check start_time and end_time columns
3. Verify data types and formats
**Expected Result**: Times stored as TIME type in HH:MM:SS format
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 8: Time Format Validation
**Objective**: Verify that various time input formats are handled correctly
**Steps**:
1. Test 24-hour format input (14:30)
2. Test 12-hour format input (2:30 PM)
3. Test edge cases (00:00, 23:59)
**Expected Result**: All formats converted and stored correctly
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

## Issues Encountered

### Database Connection Issue
**Problem**: SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)

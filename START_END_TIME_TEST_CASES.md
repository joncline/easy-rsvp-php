# Start/End Time Functionality Test Cases

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive test cases for the start/end time functionality that was added to the Easy RSVP PHP application.

## Database Schema
The `events` table includes the following time-related fields:
- `start_time` (TIME, nullable) - Event start time
- `end_time` (TIME, nullable) - Event end time

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Create Event WITH Start/End Times
**Objective**: Verify that events can be created with both start and end times
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to event creation form
2. Fill in event title: "Test Event WITH Times - Case 1"
3. Set date: "08/30/2025"
4. Set start time: "14:30" (should display as "02:30 PM")
5. Set end time: "17:00" (should display as "05:00 PM")
6. Submit form
**Expected Result**: Event created successfully with times stored in database
**Status**: ❌ FAILED - Database connection issue

### Test Case 2: Edit Event WITH Start/End Times
**Objective**: Verify that existing events with times can be edited and times persist
**Prerequisites**: Test Case 1 must pass
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to admin panel for created event
2. Click "Edit Event"

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 3: Create Event WITHOUT Start/End Times
**Objective**: Verify that events can be created without times (optional fields)
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to event creation form
2. Fill in event title: "Test Event WITHOUT Times - Case 3"
3. Set date: "09/15/2025"
4. Leave start time empty
5. Leave end time empty
6. Submit form
**Expected Result**: Event created successfully with NULL times in database
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 4: Edit Event WITHOUT Times (Add Times)
**Objective**: Verify that times can be added to existing events that didn't have them
**Prerequisites**: Test Case 3 must pass
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to admin panel for event without times
2. Click "Edit Event"
3. Verify start time field is empty
4. Verify end time field is empty
5. Add start time: "10:00"
6. Add end time: "12:00"
7. Save changes
**Expected Result**: Times are added successfully to existing event
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 5: Edit Event WITH Times (Remove Times)
**Objective**: Verify that times can be removed from existing events
**Prerequisites**: Test Case 1 must pass
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to admin panel for event with times
2. Click "Edit Event"
3. Clear start time field
4. Clear end time field
5. Save changes
**Expected Result**: Times are removed (set to NULL) in database
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 6: Edit Event WITH Times (Modify Times)
**Objective**: Verify that existing times can be modified
**Prerequisites**: Test Case 1 must pass
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to admin panel for event with times
2. Click "Edit Event"
3. Change start time from "02:30 PM" to "03:00 PM"
4. Change end time from "05:00 PM" to "06:00 PM"
5. Save changes
**Expected Result**: Modified times are saved correctly
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 7: Database Verification
**Objective**: Verify that time data is correctly stored in database
**Steps**:
1. Query events table directly
2. Check start_time and end_time columns
3. Verify data types and formats
**Expected Result**: Times stored as TIME type in HH:MM:SS format
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 8: Time Format Validation
**Objective**: Verify that various time input formats are handled correctly
**Steps**:
1. Test 24-hour format input (14:30)
2. Test 12-hour format input (2:30 PM)
3. Test edge cases (00:00, 23:59)
**Expected Result**: All formats converted and stored correctly
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

## Issues Encountered

### Database Connection Issue
**Problem**: SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ✅ Updated .env file with correct password
2. ✅ Cleared configuration cache with `php artisan config:clear`
3. ✅ Verified database connection with `php artisan migrate:status`
4. ✅ Cached configuration with `php artisan config:cache`
**Status**: ⚠️ ONGOING - Need to restart Laravel server

## Custom Fields Admin Display Test Cases

### Test Case 9: Admin Display - Text Custom Fields
**Objective**: Verify text custom field responses display correctly in admin area
**Steps**:
1. Create event with custom fields:
   - "Dietary Restrictions" (text field, required)
   - "Additional Comments" (textarea field, optional)
2. Submit RSVP with responses:
   - Name: "John Doe"
   - Response: "Yes"
   - Dietary Restrictions: "Vegetarian, no nuts"
   - Additional Comments: "Looking forward to the event!"
3. Navigate to admin area for the event
**Expected Result**: 
- RSVP shows with custom field responses
- Field names displayed in bold
- Values displayed with proper formatting
- Responses indented under the RSVP name
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 10: Admin Display - Select/Multi-Select Fields
**Objective**: Verify select and multi-select field responses display correctly
**Steps**:
1. Create event with custom fields:
   - "T-Shirt Size" (select field, options: S, M, L, XL)
   - "Preferred Activities" (multi-select field, options: Swimming, Hiking, Games, Food)
2. Submit RSVP with responses:
   - Name: "Jane Smith"
   - Response: "Maybe"
   - T-Shirt Size: "M"
   - Preferred Activities: ["Swimming", "Games"]

**Expected Result**:
- Select field shows single selected value
- Multi-select field shows comma-separated values: "Swimming, Games"
- All values properly formatted using `formatted_value` accessor
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 11: Admin Display - Mixed Response Types
**Objective**: Verify admin area handles multiple RSVPs with different response types
**Steps**:
1. Create event with various custom fields
2. Submit multiple RSVPs:
   - RSVP 1: "Yes" response with all custom fields filled
   - RSVP 2: "Maybe" response with some custom fields filled
   - RSVP 3: "No" response with minimal custom fields filled
3. Check admin area organization
**Expected Result**:
- RSVPs grouped by response type (Yes, Maybe, No)
- Each RSVP shows only the custom fields that were filled
- Empty/null custom field responses are not displayed
- Proper visual hierarchy maintained
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

### Test Case 12: Admin Display - Database Query Optimization
**Objective**: Verify efficient loading of custom field responses
**Steps**:
1. Create event with multiple custom fields
2. Submit multiple RSVPs (5+)
3. Check database queries when loading admin page
4. Verify eager loading implementation
**Expected Result**:
- Uses eager loading (`with('customFieldResponses.customField')`)
- No N+1 query problems
- Single query to load all RSVP data with relationships
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

## Next Steps
1. Test custom fields admin display functionality
2. Restart Laravel development server if needed
3. Continue with remaining time-related test cases
4. Document all results
5. Create summary report
